# POCs folder

## Purpose

The purpose of the code/projects within the POCs folder is purely to provide the simplest code possible to get started with Dapr in a Docker host (docker compose up) or in Kubernetes by testing "hello world" examples such as two services, one Web API service and another web app consuming that Web API service).

The code within the POCS folder is not really part of the "MEC Application Solution Accelerator" but just convenient "hello world" projects to get started and test Dapr.

This code is temporal and might be removed from this repo, eventualy.
