# Branch guide

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against the `dev` branch to be considered**. 
- `main`: Contains the stable code to simply try to deploy or research.

Any other branch is considered temporary (like a feature branch) and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR against them!

Thank you.
