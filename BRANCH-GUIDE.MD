# Branch guide

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against the `dev` branch to be considered**. 
- `main`: Contains the stable code to simply try to deploy (Do not use this code in MAIN branch until late February 2023. Until then, it's outdated).

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR against them!

Thank you.
