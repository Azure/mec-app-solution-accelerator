# DISCLAIMER for Alerts.UI web app

The code from this web app project (Alerts.UI) is preliminary and temporal, intended only for demo purposes.

It is not meant to be considered a reference model for production environments.
Please note that this code is subject to significant implementation improvements, not meant to be a model/reference, yet. It'll be evolved/improved soon.

Specifically, the JavaScript code in the app needs significat improvement.

The interesting code for this project is the C# code in the AlertController.cs which is using DAPR to invoke the Alerts.API microservice.

This code will also be improved to use gRPC instead of HTTP, soon.
