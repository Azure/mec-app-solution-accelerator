## Disclaimer
> This is an example application providing patterns, approaches and potential best practices targeting applications to be deployed at MEC/EDGE. 
> However, this is still an example application with no "production-ready" code but just for exploring architecture and implementation approaches. Significant areas could be improve in order to consider it "production ready" code.
> This application's code will be evolving, new features will be added and growing in the spirit of improving its quality thanks to open source contributions (PRs) from you. 
> Because of those reasons, there's no official support from Microsoft Support (CSS) about this example appilication, although the repo's owners will try to help you when possible and available. Eventually, if mature enough, Microsoft Support conditions could improved.
