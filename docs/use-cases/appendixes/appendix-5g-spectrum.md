One of the critical components of 5G is the frequency spectrum used for communication. In this document, we will explore the 5G spectrum for private networks and the countries that have regulations that allow this type of use, including the CBRS in the USA.

## The 5G Spectrum for Private Networks

The 5G spectrum for private networks is divided into three different frequency bands: low, mid, and high. Each of these bands offers unique benefits and challenges.

*   Low-band spectrum: This is the frequency range below 1 GHz, which is typically used for long-range communication. Low-band spectrum offers excellent coverage but lower data transfer rates. This frequency range is ideal for outdoor applications like smart agriculture, where the communication range is more critical than the data transfer rate.
*   Mid-band spectrum: This is the frequency range between 1 and 6 GHz, which offers a balance between coverage and data transfer rates. Mid-band spectrum is suitable for many private 5G use cases, including smart factories, smart warehouses, and industrial IoT applications.
*   High-band spectrum: This is the frequency range above 24 GHz, which offers very high data transfer rates but limited coverage. High-band spectrum is suitable for high-speed applications like virtual reality and augmented reality.

## Countries that have Regulations for Private 5G Networks

Several countries have regulations that allow the use of private 5G networks. These regulations vary by country, but they generally specify the frequency bands that can be used, the power limits, and the licensing requirements. Here are a few examples:

 **Germany**: Germany set aside 100 MHz of the 3.4-3.8 GHz 5G spectrum band for industrial use and continues to lead the adoption of Private 5G in Europe, with primary applications in the automotive manufacturing industry. 5G spectrum allocated in Germany also includes 24.25-27.5 GHz and is locally licensed on a first come, first served basis.

 **France**: France offered frequencies in the 2600 TDD MHz band (band #38, 2570-2620 MHz) to metropolitan businesses through a portal opened in May 2019. Spectrum is granted for a period of 3 to 15 years and can be renewed.

 **United Kingdom**: The UK regulator Ofcom made available 390 MHz of spectrum in the 3.8-4.2 GHz band for local access, which can be used for private 5G networks. Spectrum is licensed on a first come, first served basis, for a period of 3 to 5 years, and can be renewed.

 **Netherlands**: The Netherlands regulator ACM allocated 100 MHz of spectrum in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band for local access, which can be used for private 5G networks. Spectrum is licensed on a first come, first served basis, for a period of 10 years, and can be renewed.

 **Sweden**: Sweden regulator PTS allocated 80 MHz of spectrum in the 3.7-3.8 GHz band for local access, which can be used for private 5G networks. Spectrum is licensed on a first-come, first served basis, for a period of 15 years, and can be renewed.

 **Japan**: Japan regulator MIC allocated 28 GHz and 4.5 GHz spectrum for local 5G networks, which can be used by enterprises, local governments, and other entities. Spectrum is licensed on a first come, first served basis, for a period of 10 years, and can be renewed.

 **Australia**: Australia regulator ACMA allocated 26 GHz spectrum for area-wide apparatus licenses, which can be used for private 5G networks. Spectrum is licensed on a first-come, first served basis, for a period of 5 years, and can be renewed.

 **USA**: The USA regulator FCC made available 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band (CBRS) for shared access, which can be used for private 5G networks. Spectrum is licensed on a three-tiered model, with priority access licenses (PALs) auctioned for 10 years, general authorized access (GAA) available for free, and incumbent access for existing users.

## Shared Access spectrum in the US (CBRS).

The Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is a wireless communication framework established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. The CBRS aims to allow shared use of the 3.5 GHz frequency band between government and commercial users while protecting incumbent government users.

The CBRS framework includes the following components:

1.  **Three-Tiered Sharing Model:** The 3.5 GHz frequency band is divided into three tiers. The Incumbent Access Tier (IAT) is reserved for authorized federal government users. The Priority Access Tier (PAT) is available to qualified commercial entities that have obtained a license from the FCC. The General Authorized Access Tier (GAA) is available for shared use by any qualified user with an approved CBRS device.
2.  **Spectrum Access System (SAS):** The SAS is a cloud-based system that manages the use of the 3.5 GHz frequency band. The SAS assigns available channels to CBRS devices, enforces priority access rules, and monitors spectrum usage to ensure efficient and effective sharing.
3.  **CBRS Devices:** CBRS devices are wireless devices that can operate in the CBRS band. These devices must be certified by the FCC and registered with a SAS before they can operate in the CBRS band. CBRS devices include smartphones, routers, access points, and other wireless communication devices.
4.  **Certified Professional Installer (CPI):** is an individual who has been certified by the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to install and operate Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) devices in compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations.

The CBRS framework provides a flexible and dynamic approach to spectrum sharing, allowing for efficient and effective use of the 3.5 GHz band while ensuring that incumbent users are protected. This shared spectrum approach can enable the deployment of private 5G networks, wireless broadband services, and other advanced wireless technologies that can drive innovation and economic growth.

## Three-Tiered Sharing Model

The CBRS uses a three-tiered sharing model that divides the available spectrum into three levels, each with its own set of rules and priority access.

 **Incumbent Access Tier (IAT)**

The Incumbent Access Tier includes authorized federal government users, such as the Department of Defense and other agencies that use the 3.5 GHz band for radar and other operations. Incumbent Access users have the highest priority and are guaranteed access to the spectrum at all times. 

 **Priority Access Tier (PAT)**

The Priority Access Tier is available to qualified commercial entities that have been granted a license by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These licenses provide priority access to a portion of the 3.5 GHz band for a set period, typically three years. PAT users have priority over the third tier, but must vacate the spectrum if an incumbent access user needs it. Some companies that have a PAT License are Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Charter Communications, Comcast, and Cox Communications.

 **General Authorized Access Tier (GAA)**

The General Authorized Access Tier is available for shared use by any qualified user with an approved CBRS device. GAA users can access any available portion of the 3.5 GHz band that is not being used by IAT or PAT users. GAA users have the lowest priority and must vacate the spectrum if an incumbent access or PAT user needs it.

## Spectrum Access System (SAS)

The Spectrum Access System (SAS) is a key component of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in the United States. The SAS is responsible for managing the use of the 3.5 GHz frequency band and ensuring that all users, including incumbent government users, priority access licensees, and general authorized access users, can share the spectrum efficiently and effectively.

The SAS is responsible for allocating and managing the available spectrum in the CBRS band. It divides the spectrum into available channels and dynamically assigns them to users based on their priority level and demand. The SAS continuously monitors the spectrum usage and adjusts the allocation to optimize the usage.

 **Frequency coordination and interference avoidance**

The SAS manages frequency coordination and interference avoidance between different CBRS users. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to predict and prevent potential interference issues, which could affect the quality of service for the users.

 **CBRS device registration and authorization**

The SAS manages the registration and authorization of all CBRS devices to ensure that only authorized devices can access the spectrum. CBRS devices must be certified by the FCC and registered with a SAS before they can operate in the CBRS band. The SAS checks the devices for compliance with technical requirements and authorizes them for use in the appropriate tier.

 **Security and privacy**

The SAS ensures the security and privacy of CBRS users by authenticating and encrypting all communication between CBRS devices and the SAS. The SAS also enforces user privacy by masking user identity and location information.

The list of current SAS administrators can be found on the WInnForum page [SAS Administrators (wirelessinnovation.org)](https://cbrs.wirelessinnovation.org/sas-administrators)

## CBRS Devices 

A CBRS device is a wireless communication device that is designed to operate in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, which is a shared spectrum framework in the United States. CBRS devices must comply with technical requirements set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and must be certified by the FCC to ensure that they operate safely and efficiently.

Here are some of the key features of a CBRS device:

 **Frequency Band:** CBRS devices are designed to operate in the 3.5 GHz frequency band, which is divided into three tiers as part of the CBRS framework.

 **SAS Registration:** CBRS devices must be registered with a Spectrum Access System (SAS) to access the 3.5 GHz frequency band. The SAS manages the allocation of available channels to CBRS devices based on their priority level and demand.

 **Priority Access:** CBRS devices in the Priority Access Tier (PAT) have priority access to the spectrum over General Authorized Access Tier (GAA) devices.

 **SAS Interaction:** CBRS devices must be able to communicate with the SAS to receive channel assignments, transmit usage information, and receive updates to the CBRS framework.

 **Power and Antenna Requirements:** CBRS devices must comply with power and antenna requirements set by the FCC to ensure that they operate safely and efficiently.

CBRS devices include smartphones, routers, access points, and other wireless communication devices. They are designed to operate in the shared spectrum framework provided by the CBRS, which enables the deployment of innovative wireless services, including private 5G networks, wireless broadband, and other advanced wireless technologies.

### Certified Professional Installer (CPI)

A Certified Professional Installer (CPI) is an individual who has been certified by the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to install and operate Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) devices in compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. CPIs play an essential role in the deployment of CBRS networks and ensuring that they operate effectively and efficiently. Here are some of the key roles and responsibilities of a CPI with SAS and CBRS:

 **Installation and Configuration of CBRS devices**

CPIs are responsible for installing and configuring CBRS devices in compliance with FCC regulations and WInnForum standards. They must ensure that the devices are correctly installed and configured to operate in the appropriate CBRS tier and can communicate with the SAS.
