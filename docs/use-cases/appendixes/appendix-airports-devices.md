## Airports Appendix 1: Hardware, devices, and sensors

Drones, devices, and hardware components are key to success, as they are the “eyes” of the smart airports use case.

To help calculate the cost of hardware, devices, and sensors for the smart airports use case, this section provides examples of hardware, devices, and sensors that are capable of supporting this use case.

### Cameras

For this use case, the cameras used should cover as much distance as possible to detect events from far away. Since these cameras will be outside, they should also be weather-resistant. The cameras highlighted below can be statically placed around the perimeter for the perimeter security use case or attached to cars and drones for the runway safety use case.

The following sections discuss available cameras on the market, their specifications, and their suitability for this case study.

#### Example cameras for interiors and exteriors

##### DAHUA SECURITY – IPC-HFS (5G)

*   5G connectivity available, thus this is the selected camera for the use case.

### 5G Routers

Routers and gateways connect non 5G devices to the private mobile network. Your selected hardware and devices will determine if you require router(s) in your solution.

These two routers could cover common scenarios:

1.  Indoor Wi-Fi/Wifi6/5G router - PEGATRON\_5G\_User\_Equipment
2.  Industrial router for wired connections Perle LIRG7440 5G

### Drones

Drones are an important part of both the perimeter security and runway safety use cases, as they carry cameras which can provide a more detailed view of a perimeter breach or debris on the runway.  
Today DJI offers some of the fasted, most reliable, most performant drones in the industry. For this use case, we will show one of their models with its capabilities and pricing, along with a recommended camera that can be attached to the drone.

The drone chosen for this scenario is:

##### DJI Matrice 300

*   Link: Buy Matrice 300 RTK - DJI Store
*   Weather: Prepared for bad weather.
*   IP 45.
*   Operating temperature: -20ºC to +50 ºC (-4 ºF to +122 ºF).
*   Transmission: 15 km max transmission, with possibility of adding a 5G module.
*   Max speed: Using pilot mode (with GPS), 61 kph (17 m/s | 38 mph)
*   Drone pricing: $13,700 per drone. Cameras are bought separately.
*   Cameras: The recommended camera is the Zenmuse P1, as it offers best quality for this use case, featuring stabilization, 45 MP lens, 1/2000 seconds shutter speed, and 4.4μm pixel size.
