## Smart Roads Appendix 1: Hardware, devices, and sensors

Sensors, devices, and hardware components are key to success, as they are the “eyes” and “ears” of the smart roads use case. 

This section provides examples of hardware, devices, and sensors that are capable of supporting this use case.

### Cameras

####       Example cameras for exteriors and tunnels

*   AVALONIX camera
*   DAHUA SECURITY – IPC-HFS (5G)
*   DAHUA SECURITY – ITC952

####       Example cameras for tunnels

*   PEGATRON Nura4L (AZURE CERTIFIED)

### RWIS

The Road Weather Information System (RWIS) must be able to detect hazardous climatic conditions hazardous for drivers, including:

*   Freezing temperatures: They may cause black ice.
*   Extremely hot temperatures: They may impact the driver’s attention.
*   Rain: It reduces visibility and grip.
*   Strong winds: They may cause changes in direction and possible hazardous situations in certain vehicles, such as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars and Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs).

####        Example RWIS devices

*   Lufft (RWIS) – _it’s best to combine this sensor with others like the following_
*   Lufft Passive Road Surface Temperature Sensor WST1

####       Example Azure-certified RWIS devices

The following sensors are Azure certified but give less information about the road (mainly just temperature and humidity):

*   Advantech-WISE-4250AS
*   Lab3 SensorMine NEXUS

### MVDs

Microwave Vehicle Detectors (MVDs) are used as a traffic control device by counting cars in a single place. This input detects traffic density and measures vehicle speed to identify traffic jams and congestion.

####       Example MVDs

*   RTMS Echo

### 5G equipment

Routers and gateways connect non 5G devices to the private mobile network. Your selected hardware and devices will determine if you require router(s) in your solution.

####        Example 5G routers

*   PEGATRON Private 5G Network Solution for Digital Resilience
*   Perle LIRG7440 5G (industrial router for wired connections)
*   Inventec O-RAN BBU Server E850G4

####       Example 5G gateway

*   Inventec 5G Gateway E200G4

####       Example 5G radio unit

*   Inventec 5G Radio Unit NEX-AT021E
